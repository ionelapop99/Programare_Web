                <p> A motorcycle (or motorbike) is a vehicle used to transport people from
                     one place to another.
                     It does not have 4 wheels like a car. It has 2
                      wheels like a bicycle. 
                      But it has a motor like a car. A motorcycle is 
                      normally driven by one person. A passenger can also ride on the back
                       of the motorcycle. Some motorcycles have a sidecar that can carry 
                       another passenger.
